## 🔑 Key Insights

### 📈 Membership Growth  
Registrations showed a slight upward trend from **January 2023 to June 2023**.  

### 🎯 Points Dynamics  
Members consistently **earned more points than they redeemed** between **January 2023 and November 2024**, with redemption activity peaking roughly every two months.  

### 🛒 Redemption Preference  
**Shopping Discounts** were the most popular redemption type.  

### 🏬 Store Activity  
- **High Activity**: Parramatta, Bankstown, Hornsby, Blacktown, and Campbelltown recorded the highest levels of active points transactions.  
- **Low Redemption**: Penrith, Liverpool, and Chatswood showed lower points redemption, which may indicate:  
  - **Members Saving Points** – customers accumulating points for larger rewards instead of redeeming frequently.  
  - **Awareness Gaps** – some shoppers may not know how or where to redeem their points.  
  - **Limited Promotions/Incentives** – fewer in-store campaigns or reminders encouraging redemption.  
  - **Channel Shift** – members earning points at these stores but redeeming online or at other locations.  
  - **Perceived Value Gap** – redemptions at these stores may be seen as less valuable compared to alternatives (e.g., online discounts, gift cards).
